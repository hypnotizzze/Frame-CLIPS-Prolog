# Frame-CLIPS-Prolog

Using the description of the subject area, develop a program for creating and editing a frame representation of the subject area according to the task option, as well as semantic and syntactic matching of prototype frames and instance frames in it using the capabilities of the CLIPS environment.


It is necessary to develop a downloadable static knowledge base for the SWI-Prolog system, consisting of the predicate specified in the task, and auxiliary predicates that allow you to implement the specified predicate without referring to any standard predicates.
